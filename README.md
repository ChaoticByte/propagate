This project aims to develop a specification and software suite for the easy creation of distributed networks on top of websockets, specifically for **broadcasting** text messages.

The goal of this implementation is not to be very efficient or sophisticated, but instead attempts to "just work".

See [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) for the specification.

# Python Implementation
